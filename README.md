# RL-agent-langgraph

Language Agent Tree Search (LATS) is a general LLM agent search algorithm that combines reflection/evaluation and search (specifically Monte-Carlo trees search) to achieve better overall task performance compared to similar techniques like ReACT, Reflexion, or even Tree of Thoughts. It adopts a standard reinforcement learning (RL) task framing, replacing the RL agents, value functions, and optimizer all with calls to an LLM. This is meant to help the agent adapt and problem solve for complex tasks, avoiding getting stuck in repetitive loops.
